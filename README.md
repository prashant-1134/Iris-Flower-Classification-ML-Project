Â Iris-Flower-Classification-ML Project
The objective of this project is to use machine learning techniques to categorize iris blossoms into several species. To get precise predictions, three distinct methods are used: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree Classifier. The models are trained and tested using the Iris dataset, a popular machine learning dataset.
The evaluation results are shown for each algorithm, highlighting the corresponding recall, accuracy, precision, and F1-score.
